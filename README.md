# 🗝️ The Five Prototypes

Welcome, adventurer.

You have entered **The Catacombs of the Class**, where five ancient pedestals await reconstruction. Only by mastering the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C# can you unlock the sealed door and proceed to the **Fountain of Objects**.

This repository contains five foundational class-building challenges, each representing a lost **Prototype** you must reassemble. Each "Boss Battle" challenges your understanding of classes, properties, constructors, enums, control flow, and encapsulation.

## 🧩 The Prototypes

### 1. **The Point** – *75 XP*
Create a 2D `Point` class with constructors and immutable coordinates. Understand the purpose of immutability in value objects.

### 2. **The Color** – *100 XP*
Craft a `Color` class using RGB channels. Learn the difference between static properties and instance data.

### 3. **The Card** – *100 XP*
Model a card using `enum` types for color and rank. Generate a full deck and explore classification logic (number vs. symbol).

### 4. **The Door** – *100 XP*
Build a secure `Door` class with state transitions and passcode management. Practice condition-based methods and user interaction.

### 5. **The Password Validator** – *100 XP*
Design a `PasswordValidator` class that checks password rules. Learn to work with characters, validation logic, and input loops.
